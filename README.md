## Parody Destiny Website

I implemented this website as part of the interview process for a company I was interested in. The premise of the website is that it offers courses taught by well known Destiny content creators so that players can learn how to play the Hunter in PVP game modes. 

This website helped me get more practice in making something completely from scratch and trying to stay true to an example layout. In terms of the content that appears on the website, this was good practice in trying to create concise writeups that would get a potential user invested in using the service (aside from the section where I display "reviews" from past users -- I couldn't come up with reviews that sounded sincere).

This was also another good opportunity for me to work with images and manipulating them both in React and with pure CSS.
